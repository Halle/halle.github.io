*1.*

A couple weeks ago, I ran aground in the Principality of Ill-At-Ease, also known as the Horse Latitudes or [Doldrums](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/doldrums). I think this is a place that most people working in creative fields visit more regularly than we like to admit. 

I was there after shipping an unusually-large and tumultuous update that took too long by my reckoning, involving a hard-to-digest mix of interesting intellectual problems and grim ditch-digging in support of platform changes. Like a banquet of *petits fours* and asphalt, and you are the only one at the banquet, and everything must be eaten. 

It was a good update in the end, but it was one of those ones where after you do your job and you put it out there, you are a little bit haunted with the question of what kind of reception for your work it would take in order for you to feel psychologically restored (answer: a parade).

After I had annoyed myself and my mate sufficiently with my post-launch horrors and bad-sleep grouchiness, it was getting to be time to do something.

I live on the most interesting bus line in Berlin. It is called the M29 and it connects the poorest and wealthiest neighborhoods in the city on a long and meandering trip through the back reaches of the universe, also known as Charlottenburg. The M29 contains everything in life. I packed an overnight bag and I got on the bus, so then it contained me too.

It takes an hour to take the bus from my street to its terminus in a neighborhood of quarter-acre mansions near the edge of the Grunewald, the largest of Berlin's many forests. While the city went past I replaced the passwords on my phone with incorrect passwords, so that the notions and words, and the feelings and the hope of feelings, and all the things that are in there, were not there any more, and I was only on the bus, and who wasn't with me, was not with me.

I got off the bus and began the hour's walk to the forest. The farther I walked, the finer and simpler the houses became, first new-built McMansions but gradually giving way to much older villas in the Prussian style, on increasingly larger plots, until the forest was in front of me and the houses were behind. I went through an empty tunnel under an overpass and was surrounded by trees. A man was camping there, not on vacation. I nodded and he nodded back and I started my long walk.

The Grunewald is huge, about the size of Manhattan from Wall Street to Midtown, and only forest. After the first man, I didn't see another human being for half an hour. It was very cold, and there wasn't yet a bud on a tree.

In the heart of the forest I started to see eerie piles of sticks, and I was happy.

The forest has always been a dangerous place, which is why the stories are set there. In the Grunewald you could be trampled by wild boar, but you could also be mugged. You can meet strange people in any forest. The forest is dangerous because it's large and you're isolated, and city person will tell you that risk is easier to manage where there are bodegas to duck into. On the other hand, the forest is one of the only places where it's acceptable to equip a branch taller than yourself with a heavy knurl at the top on the pretext of walking with it, if you're unsettled. But you may end up as the strange person in someone else's forest story.

At the end of a long logging road, two hours in, I saw a milestone for my destination, Schildhorn.

The path picked up and took me up a hill, where I could see the Wannsee below, which is Berlin's most beautiful lake and my destination. The name Wannsee is infamous. I don't find it coincidental that the National Socialists came to the place in Berlin which is the most full of life and beauty, which was for every Berliner, in order to plan the project of murder â€“ they were not only murderers but also vandals, and misusing this place was another petty act of vandalism on the road to atrocity. But we swim here every week in the summer, Eva and I. It is returned to every kind of person who they imagined could be erased, and the lake buoys us up and it loves us back. Down the hill, under a tunnel, and then just one hundred meters from the entrance to the lakefront hotel it only first began to rain, and I smiled up from under the aegis.

After warming up with a Schnitzel mit Pommes, I sat on my room's balcony with a glass of wine and looked out at the lake, with no one else in sight and no sound of others, in a city of millions, and started writing until it got dark and I heard the first owl. When we talk about problems which are difficult to fix, we're asked to be concrete: "How to feel much better." But most significant things occur in external silence and are so immaterial we don't mark their changes of state at all, so this becomes another way to make ourselves into hucksters and others into rubes. "An impression of some events surrounding my feeling just better enough that I thought I would probably start to feel actually better in a couple of weeks" doesn't have the same ring to it, but when I woke up the next morning, it was enough.

The Schildhorn, where the hotel is, is the site of a local saga called the Schildhornsage or Jaxe-Sage, which also purports to explain why it is called the Schildhorn (Shield-Horn): in the 12th century, Jaksa z Kopnika, the prince of the Western Slavic Sprevani people who lived here at that time, lost a battle with Albrecht The Bear of the house Askania, a German who was fighting to establish the settlement of Brandenburg, and Jaksa fled him by riding his horse into the Wannsee. The exhausted horse began to sink beneath the waves. When the pagan god Triglav didn't hear Jaksa's pleas for intervention, in desperation he called out to the Christian god to save him, and felt himself buoyed up as if from his shield, and his horse got a second wind, so he pledged himself to the new god, and as a sign of faith he hung his shield on an oak.

This is pretty good as sagas go, but I like it much better in reverse:

"Only 25 generations ago, this land was the place of the people of the Spree, who were followers of the god with three faces. Their only church was under the sky, and you could see where they gathered in the forest by the way they dressed the tree trunks with carefully-arranged branches..."

### *The End.*
