<p>
My name is Halle and I live in Berlin. I'm an American with an unusual first name, rather than a German with an inexplicable first name. The wren is a very tiny bird with very improbable ambitions, and he is known as the king is a large number of languages. In German he is known as the Zaunk√∂nig, or Fence King.
