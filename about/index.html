<p>
My name is Halle and I live in Berlin. I'm an American with an unusual first name, rather than a German with an inexplicable first name. The wren is a small bird with improbable ambitions, and for this reason he is known as “king” in many languages. In German he is known as the Zaunkönig, or Fence King.
